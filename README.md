# Kattis Solutions

During my time as a TA for IT5001 in NUS, I was introduced to Kattis as an equivalent to LeetCode;
both are websites used by those into competitive programming.
Having not done this before, I decided I should at least try my hand at solving as many problems - not only to satiate any urge for sharpening my programming prowess, but also since it's sworn by some of the taught courses here.

At present moment, I have solved the following using Python 3 (primarily due to ease and relativity to IT5001).
However, I may populate a separate subfolder in this repository if I choose to try my hand at solving the problem using a different programming language.
