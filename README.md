# Kattis Solutions

During my time as a TA for IT5001 in NUS, I was introduced to [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) as an equivalent to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/);
both are websites used by those into competitive programming.
Having not done this before, I decided I should at least try my hand at solving as many problems as I can.Some of the problems are stupid challenging, and I do wish I dabbled with this much earlier during my undergraduate years.

At present, I have solved a couple of problems, mostly using Python 3.
This also includes some that have been done my A/P Steven Halim during IT5003 lectures I attended.
Each attempt is categorized in subfolders following the type(s) of programming languages the problems were solved in.

To view the problem I solved, head over to `https://open.kattis.com/problems/<name_of_file>`.
I have named each solution file according to the name of the Kattis page containing the problem.
If there are problems that are available on NUS's Kattis subdomain, these will be mentioned at the beginning of the respective files.
